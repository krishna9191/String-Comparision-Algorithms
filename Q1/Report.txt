Speed of the Algorithms also depends on distribution of characters. For the DataSet used, the speed of 

Boyer Moore-Bad Character  > boyer Moore-Good Suffix > KMP > Rabin Karps > Naive 

DataSet-1 :

Time for Boyer Moore -Good Suffix 0


Dataset-2 :

Time for Naive 4

Time for Rabin Karps 3

Time for KMP 2

Time for Boyer Moore -Bad Character 1

Time for Boyer Moore -Good Suffix 2
